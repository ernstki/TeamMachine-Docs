# TeamMachine
## A Tool for Connected Collaboration

## Introduction
In today’s fast paced world, it can be very challenging to network and meet
new people with similar interests and experiences with technology and
development. Developers may be working on very similar projects or may need
assistance with a project, but have no readily accessible means of meeting
other developers with knowledge and experience or find mentors to help further
refine their own skills.

TeamMachine is a web service and Android mobile application which aims to help
connect developers with similar interests in a collaborative environment would
promote faster development and shared research, and build upon existing
research.

These interests could be highlighted through a short survey, some
options to like different projects, and even education and employment
backgrounds. Users would also be able to form collaborative efforts on
different projects with other users in the nearby area, stimulating
development of new technology and other design applications. In essence, the
application would be used to connect "Think Tanks" within local areas to
collaboratively share knowledge and development with each other. 

### Scope
The TeamMachine project will initially target software developers in
a single municipality (the city of Cincinnati, OH) who wish to find other
programmers to participate in small-group collaborations.

The fundamental idea behind TeamMachine could, however, be easily expanded to
different applications, such as art, music, web design, system design, and
many other research and development activities. Users would be automatically
matched up based on the projects/ideas that interest them, and can communicate
with groups from within the application. Users would also be able to join
a public project, such as “3D Printing”, but could also join a private
collaboration within 3d printing that aids in the development of individual
projects and communication.

### Objectives and Success Criteria
The objectives of the TeamMachine project are to:

* Facilitate communication between users based on projects/ideas
  that rank according to their provided interests profile
* Create a system of peer rating and credentialing which can be used to
  certify individuals' skills and evaluate their suitability for collaboration
* Provide basic groupware functions such as email discussion lists or live chat*

\* _Stretch goals: only if primary functionality is implemented ahead of
    schedule_
