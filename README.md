# TeamMachine Project Documentation

A somewhat-finalized requirements document for the TeamMachine project
incorporating all class contributions from the EECE3093C [OneNote notebook][1]
and UMLet [UML diagrams][2].

## Credits
The [HTML version][3] of this document makes use of Junil Um's
[markdown-toc][4], which in turn makes use of the [Tocify][5] jQuery plugin by
Greg Franko.

The [PDF version][6] of this document was created with John MacFarlane's
[Pandoc][7] document processing system.
